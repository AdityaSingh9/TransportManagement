# TransportManagement
Mulesoft API led project on Transport Management 

Following project provides a platform to perform booking services for land, air
and sea transport across the world.
It will enable customers to query location routes and the departure schedule
from multiple transport providers, and make booking directly to the platform. 
This platform will connect to the respective transport providers back end systems, to query
for the available routes and schedules and make purchases, track their booking and make
changes to their bookings.
